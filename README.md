# DayPilot

AI-powered daily planner built with Flutter + Serverpod + Gemini.

## What it does
DayPilot converts natural language tasks into a structured daily schedule.

Examples:
- Gym 09:00 60min, Work 16:00 240min, Sleep
- Study 120min, Mass 17:00, Dinner 30min

The app automatically:
- Parses times
- Uses durations
- Organizes the day
- Fills gaps intelligently

If AI is unavailable, a local fallback planner still generates a schedule.
